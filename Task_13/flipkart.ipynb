    "To help Elon Musk estimate the selling price of his laptops and give recommendations on pricing strategy, as described in the project requirements for the Flipkart laptop dataset, you could follow these general steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean and preprocess the laptop data: This will involve tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing data (e.g., imputation), and converting variables to the appropriate data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations: This will help to gain insights into the distribution of variables, relationships between variables (e.g., correlation), and potential outliers or unusual observations.\n",

    "python code for Flipkart Laptop Data - Business Insights on Product Pricing Dataset Link - laptop_details.csv Problem Statement Elon Musk has started his own laptop company (Tesla Laptop) in India. He wants to give tough fights to big companies like Apple, Alienware, HP etc. He does not know how to estimate the price of laptops his company creates. In this competitive laptop market you cannot simply assume things. Musk wants to find out some relation between features of a Laptop(eg:- RAM, OS, etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Data Mining. 😥 To solve this problem he already asked his Data Engineering team (from Twitter 🐥🤭) to collect laptop data from various competitors. Now he needs your (i.e Data Scientist’s) help to solve the following problem. 🥰 Sprint - 1 (Data Analysis and Mining) Musk’s Requirements 1. Build an interface (using streamlit) for Elon Musk where he can enter the laptop features like RAM Size, RAM Type, HDD, OS, etc. and get the price prediction. 2. Based on your Data Analysis and MIning skills, give recommendations to Elon Musk on how the pricing works in the laptop market.\n",
